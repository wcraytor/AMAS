Appraisal Model Adjustment Standard

This website is for research and development of a standard for specifying appraisal models based on a common and openly available language that can incorporate, initially, the output models of Salford Systesms (MiniTab) MARS(t) and R-Language Earth.   Models expressed in this standard can be uploaded in to appraisal software tools which support the standard and these tools will then parse the model into individual feature adjustment code which they can execute to make the adjustments between sales comparables and the subject property.
